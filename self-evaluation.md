# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

* Not confident at all.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

* A lot of unproductive struggle. I think I've spent over three hours on iterations alone.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

* I think all of it. This feels like the first segment where nothing feels like it "stuck".

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

* I'll keep reaching out for help and asking questions.
